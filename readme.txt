A lightweight decisions not options related posts plugin.

== Description ==

Quickly increase your readers' engagement by adding related posts to the bottom of your post content.

Posts with the **most terms in common** will display at the top! 

This plugin is capable of finding related posts in multiple **taxonomies** and **post types**. Include or exclude terms from the search for related posts. Change the look and feel by using your own templates in your (child) theme.

Additionally this plugin allows you to override the related posts that are automatically generated and choose your own related posts.

**Requires wp_body_open**

Note this plugin requires wordpress 5.2 and for your theme to support the wp_body_open hook (most good themes do).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the layout for the related posts? =
Yes. Copy the entire lh_rpbt-templates directory from the plugin into your active wordpress theme (or child theme if you are using one) and edit away.

= How do I customise the related posts that are displayed? =
Add the [lh_rpbt_display post_ids="28353,28367,44"] shortcode, the post_ids the only only attribute and specify which posts, pages, or cpts you want displayed.

= Why are LocalHero plugins better? =

All localHero plugins are built for my own use. Almost all including this one I use. As I use it is built with two principles in mind. Firstly to one thing thing very well, hence no bloat and no upsells. Secondly to follow wordpress standards.

= Can you give me some examples of sites running this plugin?  =

The [LocalHero project website](https://lhero.org) and the [Melbourne touch rugby association](https://princesparktouch.com) I founded both run on the same multisite that uses this plugin. Visit singular posts or pages to view it in action.

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Related Posts by Taxonomy, and all [LocalHero](https://lhero.org) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-related-posts-by-taxonomy/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-related-posts-by-taxonomy). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
